# Hey there!

I'm Lauren, and I'm all about architecting tomorrow's digital solutions, right here in Ohio. By day, I'm diving into the world of software development, but from a different angle â€“ I'm not the one writing the code, but I'm definitely in the thick of it! I get to be the bridge between all these cool ideas and making them actually happen. It's pretty awesome working with developers, ux designers, product strategists and all sorts of folks to create digital products that people will love using.

But when I'm off the clock? That's when I really geek out. I'm constantly diving into cloud engineering, coding, and cybersecurity, just because I love it. One day I'm messing around with cloud platforms, the next I'm putting on my SOC analyst hat to explore threat detection techniques. I just can't get enough of learning all these new things and I'm here for all of it. 

I document all of this on my blog. It's where I share my technical knowledge, the challenges I face, and any helpful tips I discover along the way. It's my digital playground where I get to learn out loud and maybe help a few fellow tech enthusiasts along the way! 

Speaking of blogs, I built this site using Chirpy, a text-focused Jekyll theme that operates in a Jekyll environment. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. The site is configured with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes. It's all open source, and you can view it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/lauren-che/lauren-che.github.io).
